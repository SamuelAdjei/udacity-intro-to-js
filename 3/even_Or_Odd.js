/*
Write an if...else statement that:

prints "even" if the number is an even number
prints "odd" if the number is an odd number

Hint: Use the % (modulo) operator to determine if a number is even or odd. 

The modulo operater takes two numbers and returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second one:

console.log(12 % 3);
console.log(10 % 4);
Result: 
0 
2

The answer for 12 % 3 is 0 because twelve divided by three has no remainder. 
10 % 4 is 2 because ten divided by 4 has a remainder of two.

Make sure to test your code with different values. For example:

If number equals 1, then odd should be printed to the console.
If number equals 12, then even should be printed to the console.


Your Code:

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Even or Odd (3-2)
 *
 * Write an if...else statement that prints `even` if the 
 * number is even and prints `odd` if the number is odd.
 *
 * Note - make sure to print only the string "even" or the string "odd"
 */

// change the value of `number` to test your if...else statement
var number = 2;

if (number % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("even");
} else {
    console.log("odd");
}
