/* Build a string using concatenation by combining the lines from this famous haiku poem by Yosa Buson.

Blowing from the west
Fallen leaves gather
In the east.
Each string should be printed on its own line.

Hint: You will need to use special characters to produce the following output. 
For a refresher, feel free to review the previous Escaping Strings lesson in this course.
